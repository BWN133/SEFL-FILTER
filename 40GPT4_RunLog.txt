Over 20 weeks, he makes $37500 x 20 = $<<37500*20=750000>>750000. He also had to pay $2000 to create the movie, so his total cost is $2000 + ($6 x 500 x 5 x 20) = $<<2000+(6*500*5*20)=62000>>62000.

How much was her previous monthly income?\n', 'solution': "Let's denote Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income as X. Then, her rent and utilities cost amounted to 40% * X = 0.4X. After the salary increase, her monthly income became X + $600 and her rent and utilities now cost 25% * (X + $600) = 0.25 * (X + $600). Since the cost didn't change, we can equate these two expressions: 0.4X = 0.25 * (X + $600). Solving this equation gives X = $1500. Therefore, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was $1500.", 'answer': '1500', 'Step': 'First_Solve'}, {'question': 'Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities.

After the salary increase, her income became X + $600, and the expenses for rent and utilities equal 25% of this amount, which is 0.25 * (X + $600). These two amounts are equal, so we have the equation: 0.4X = 0.25 * (X + $600). Solving this equation for X, we get X = 0.25 * $600 / (0.4 - 0.25) = $<<0.25*600/(0.4-0.25)=1500>>1500", 'answer': '1500', 'Step': 'First_Solve'}, {'question': 'Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities.

After the salary increase, her income became X + $600, and the expenses for rent and utilities is now 25% of this amount, which is 0.25 * (X + $600). Since the amount spent on rent and utilities remains the same even after the salary increase, we equate the two expressions: 0.4X = 0.25 * (X + $600). This equation simplifies to 0.4X = 0.25X + 0.25*600. Solving for X, we get: 0.15X = 0.25*600. Therefore, X = (0.25*600)/0.15 = $1000.

If we subtract 0.25X from both sides, we get $150 = 0.15X.

To solve this equation for X, we need to subtract 0.25X from both sides to get 0.15X = $150. Now we need to divide both sides by 0.15 to solve for X. Therefore, her previous income was X = $150 / 0.15 = $1000. However, this is incorrect because the equation setup is wrong. The correct equation should be 0.25*(X+$600) = 0.4X + $600 * 0.4. If we simplify this equation, we get 0.25X + $150 = 0.4X + $240.

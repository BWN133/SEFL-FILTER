Also, the number of peppers is twice the number of cucumbers, so P = 2C. Therefore, the total number of vegetables produced is 237 (potatoes) + C (cucumbers) + P (peppers) = 237 + (237 - 60) + 2(237 - 60) = 237 + 177 + 354 = 768 vegetables produced by the garden.", "answer": "768", "Step": "Rechecked"}, {"question": "A garden produced 237 potatoes, 60 fewer cucumbers and twice as many peppers than the cucumbers. How many vegetables did the garden produce?\n", "solution": "Let x be the number of cucumbers. The number of peppers is 2x. The total number of vegetables is x + 2x + (x-60) = 237. Solving for x gives us x = 79 cucumbers. Therefore, the number of vegetables produced by the garden is 79 cucumbers + 2(79) peppers + 79 - 60 cucumbers = 79 + 158 + 19 = 256 vegetables.", "answer": "256", "Step": "pickCorrect"}]}

After her salary increase, she now spends 25% of her income on rent and utilities, which is 0.25(x + 600). Since the amounts she spends on rent and utilities are the same before and after the salary increase, we can set up the equation 0.4x = 0.25(x + 600) and solve for x. Solving for x gives x = 1500. Therefore, Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was $1500.", "answer": "1500", "Step": "pickCorrect"}]}

How many vegetables did the garden produce?\n", "solution": "Let's denote the number of cucumbers as x. Then, the number of peppers would be 2x, and the number of potatoes would be 60 + x (since there are 60 fewer cucumbers than potatoes). Therefore, the total number of vegetables produced is x + 2x + 60 + x = 4x + 60. Given that the garden produced 237 potatoes, we have 237 = 4x + 60. Solving for x, we get x = (237 - 60) / 4 = 177 / 4 = 44.25. Since x represents whole cucumbers, we take the floor function to get x = 44. Therefore, the total number of vegetables produced is 4 * 44 + 60 = 236 vegetables.", "answer": "236", "Step": "pickCorrect"}]}

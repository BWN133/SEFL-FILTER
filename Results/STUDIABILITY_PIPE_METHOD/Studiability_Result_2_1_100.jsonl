Therefore, she would have 24 - 15 = 9 more fish in the first tank than in the second tank.", "answer": "9", "Step": "Rechecked"}, {"question": "Gail has two fish tanks. The first tank is twice the size of the second tank. There are 48 gallons of water in the first tank. She follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish. If she keeps two-inch fish in the second tank and three-inch fish in the first tank, how many more fish would Gail have in the first tank than the second tank if one of the first tank fish eats another?\n", "solution": "Since the first tank has 48 gallons of water and follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish, there are 48 * 3 = 144 inches of fish in the first tank. If one of the three-inch fish eats another, there would be 144 / 3 - 1 = 47 fish left in the first tank. The second tank has two-inch fish, so there are 48 / 2 = 24 inches of fish in the second tank. Therefore, the second tank would have 24 fish. Hence, Gail would have 47 - 24 = 23 more fish in the first tank than the second tank if one of the first tank fish eats another.", "answer": "23", "Step": "pickCorrect"}]}

{"question": "Two trains leave San Rafael at the same time. They begin traveling westward, both traveling for 80 miles. The next day, they travel northwards, covering 150 miles. What's the distance covered by each train in the two days?\n", "solution": "In the two days, each train covers a total distance of 80 miles westward and 150 miles northwards. Therefore, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is 80 + 150 = 230 miles.", "result": "230", "Step": "First_Solve"}

{"question": "Sansa is a famous artist, she can draw a portrait and sell it according to its size. She sells an 8-inch portrait for $5, and a 16-inch portrait for twice the price of the 8-inch portrait. If she sells three 8-inch portraits and five 16-inch portraits per day, how many does she earns every 3 days?", "solution": "Sansa earns $5 x 3 = $15 for every 8-inch portrait. She earns $10 x 5 = $50 for every 16-inch portrait. Therefore, every day she earns $15 x 3 + $50 x 5 = $245. Every 3 days, she earns $245 x 3 = $735.", "answer": "735", "Step": "First_Solve"}

{"question": "Gail has two fish tanks. The first tank is twice the size of the second tank. There are 48 gallons of water in the first tank. She follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish. If she keeps two-inch fish in the second tank and three-inch fish in the first tank, how many more fish would Gail have in the first tank than the second tank if one of the first tank fish eats another?\n", "solution": "Since the first tank has 48 gallons of water and follows the rule of one gallon per inch of fish, there are 48 * 3 = 144 inches of fish in the first tank. Therefore, there are 144 / 3 = 48 three-inch fish in the first tank. The second tank has two-inch fish, so there are 48 / 2 = 24 two-inch fish in the second tank. If one of the three-inch fish eats another, there will be 48 - 1 = 47 three-inch fish in the first tank, and 24 + 1 = 25 two-inch fish in the second tank. Therefore, there will be 47 - 25 = 22 more fish in the first tank than the second tank.", "answer": "22", "Step": "First_Solve"}

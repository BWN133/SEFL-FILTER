{"question": "Gail has two fish tanks. The first tank is twice the size of the second tank. There are 48 gallons of water in the first tank. She follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish. If she keeps two-inch fish in the second tank and three-inch fish in the first tank, how many more fish would Gail have in the first tank than the second tank if one of the first tank fish eats another?\n", "solution": "The second tank has 48 / 2 = 24 gallons of water. Since one gallon of water is needed for each inch of fish, the second tank can hold 24 * 2 = 48 two-inch fish. The first tank can hold 48 / 3 = 16 three-inch fish. If one fish from the first tank eats another, there would be 16 - 1 = 15 three-inch fish left in the first tank. Therefore, there would be 15 - 48 = -33 more fish in the first tank than the second tank if one fish eats another.", "answer": "-33", "Step": "First_Solve"}

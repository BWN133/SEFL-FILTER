{"question": "Tina makes $18.00 an hour.  If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?\n", "solution": "Tina makes $18.00 an hour. If she works 8 hours or less, she makes 18*8 = 144 per day. If she works more than 8 hours, she gets paid overtime, which is 18 + (1/2)*18 = 27 per hour. So for the 2 extra hours she works each day, she makes 27*2 = 54 extra per day. For 5 days, she makes 144*3 (for the first 8 hours) + 54*2 (for the overtime hours) = 432 + 108 = 540 in total for the week.", "answer": "540", "Step": "First_Solve"}

{"question": "Tony can run a mile twice as fast as Tina, who with a time of 6 minutes is one-third as fast a runner as Tom.  What are all three of their mile times when added together?", "solution": "First, find Tom's mile time by dividing Tina's time by 3: 6 minutes / 3 = 2 minutes. Next, find Tina's time by doubling Tom's time: 2 minutes * 2 = 4 minutes. Finally, find Tony's time by doubling Tina's time: 4 minutes * 2 = 8 minutes. Add all three times together: 2 minutes + 4 minutes + 8 minutes = 14 minutes.", "answer": "14", "Step": "First_Solve"}

What are all three of their mile times when added together?", "solution": "First, find Tom's mile time by dividing Tina's time by 3: 6 minutes / 3 = 2 minutes. Next, find Tina's time by tripling Tom's time: 2 minutes * 3 = 6 minutes. Finally, find Tony's time by doubling Tina's time: 6 minutes * 2 = 12 minutes. Add all three times together: 2 minutes + 6 minutes + 12 minutes = 20 minutes.", "answer": "20", "Step": "Rechecked"}
{"question": "Tony can run a mile twice as fast as Tina, who with a time of 6 minutes is one-third as fast a runner as Tom.  What are all three of their mile times when added together?", "solution": "Tina runs a mile in 6 minutes, which means Tom runs a mile in 6 x 3 = 18 minutes. Tony runs a mile twice as fast as Tina, so he runs a mile in 6 / 2 = 3 minutes. Therefore, when we add all three of their mile times together, we get 6 + 18 + 3 = 27 minutes.", "answer": "27", "Step": "First_Solve"}

{"question": "Tony can run a mile twice as fast as Tina, who with a time of 6 minutes is one-third as fast a runner as Tom.  What are all three of their mile times when added together?", "solution": "Since Tina is one-third as fast as Tom, Tom's time is 6 / (1/3) = 6 * 3 = 18 minutes. Therefore, Tina's time is 6 minutes and Tony's time is twice as fast, so Tony's time is 6 / 2 = 3 minutes. The sum of all three of their mile times is 18 + 6 + 3 = 27 minutes.", "answer": "27", "Step": "First_Solve"}

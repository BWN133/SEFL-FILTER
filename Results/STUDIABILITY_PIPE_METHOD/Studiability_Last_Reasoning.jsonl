{"question": "Anna goes trick-or-treating in a subdivision where she gets 14 pieces of candy per house. Her brother Billy goes trick-or-tricking in a neighboring subdivision where he gets 11 pieces of candy per house. If the first subdivision has 60 houses and the second subdivision has 75 houses, how many more pieces of candy does Anna get?\n", "solution": "Anna gets 14 x 60 = <<14*60=840>>840 pieces of candy from the first subdivision. \nBilly gets 11 x 75 = <<11*75=825>>825 pieces of candy from the second subdivision. \nTherefore, Anna gets 840 - 825 = <<840-825=15>>15 more pieces of candy than Billy.", "answer": "15", "Step": "First_Solve"}

The correct solution is as follows: Anna gets 14 pieces of candy from each of the 60 houses, for a total of 14 x 60 = 840 pieces of candy. Billy gets 11 pieces of candy from each of the 75 houses, for a total of 11 x 75 = 825 pieces of candy. The difference in the number of candies they get is 840 - 825 = 15 pieces of candy.", "answer": "15", "Step": "Rechecked"}

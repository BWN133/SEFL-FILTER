{"question": "Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?", "solution": "In total, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups of feed in the first two meals of the day. Since she feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, the total cups of feed needed for the flock of 20 chickens in the first two meals is 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups of feed. Therefore, in the final meal of the day, Wendi needs to give her chickens 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups of feed.", "result": "20", "Step": "First_Solve"}

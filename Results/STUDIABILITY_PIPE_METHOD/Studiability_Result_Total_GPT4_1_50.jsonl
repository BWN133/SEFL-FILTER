Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income. How much was her previous monthly income?\n", "solution": "Let's denote Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income as X. Her expenses for rent and utilities were 40% of X, which is 0.4 * X. After the salary increase, her income became X + $600, and the expenses for rent and utilities is now 25% of this amount, which is 0.25 * (X + $600). Since the amount spent on rent and utilities remains the same even after the salary increase, we equate the two expressions: 0.4X = 0.25 * (X + $600). This equation simplifies to 0.4X = 0.25X + 0.25*600. Solving for X, we get: 0.15X = 0.25*600. Therefore, X = (0.25*600)/0.15 = $1000.

{"question": "Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?\n", "answer": "The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000\nHe increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000\nSo the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000\nSo he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000\n#### 70000<|endoftext|>", "Incorrect Answer": "Step 1: Calculate the total cost Josh spent on buying and repairing the house.\n- Josh bought the house for $80,000.\n- He spent $50,000 on repairs.\n- Therefore, the total cost was $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the increased value of the house after repairs.\n- The value of the house increased by 150%.\n- This means the value increased by 150% of $130,000.\n- 150% of $130,000 is 1.5 * $130,000 = $195,000.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the profit Josh made.\n- Profit = Increased value - Total cost\n- Profit = $195,000 - $130,000 = $65,000\n\n#### 65000"}

{"question": "Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?\n", "answer": "There are 80/100 * 10 = <<80/100*10=8>>8 more purple flowers than yellow flowers.\nSo in Mark's garden, there are 10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 purple flowers.\nPurple and yellow flowers sum up to 10 + 18 = <<10+18=28>>28 flowers.\nThat means in Mark's garden there are 25/100 * 28 = <<25/100*28=7>>7 green flowers.\nSo in total Mark has 28 + 7 = <<28+7=35>>35 plants in his garden.\n#### 35<|endoftext|>", "Incorrect Answer": "1. Let's denote the number of yellow flowers as Y. According to the information given, there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers. This means there are 80/100 * Y = 0.8Y more purple flowers. Therefore, the total number of purple flowers is Y + 0.8Y = 1.8Y.\n\n2. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. This means the number of green flowers is 25/100 * (Y + 1.8Y) = 0.25 * 2.8Y = 0.7Y.\n\n3. The total number of flowers in Mark's garden is the sum of yellow, purple, and green flowers: Y + 1.8Y + 0.7Y = 3.5Y.\n\n4. Therefore, the total number of flowers in Mark's garden is 3.5Y.\n\n#### 3.5"}
{"question": "A deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?\n", "answer": "Let S be the number of people on the first hundred years\u2019 ship.\nThe second hundred years\u2019 ship had twice as many as the first, so it had 2S people.\nThe third hundred years\u2019 ship had twice as many as the second, so it had 2 * 2S = <<2*2=4>>4S people.\nAll the ships had S + 2S + 4S = 7S = 847 people.\nThus, the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years had S = 847 / 7 = <<847/7=121>>121 people on it.\n#### 121<|endoftext|>", "Incorrect Answer": "1. The three hundred years are broken down into three separate time periods of one hundred years each. \nLet's denote the number of people on the ship during the first hundred years as x.\nDuring the second hundred years, the ship has twice the number of people as the first hundred years, so it would be 2x.\nAnd during the third hundred years, the ship has twice as many people as the second hundred years, so it would be 2*(2x) = 4x.\nThe total number of people eaten by the monster over the three hundred years is the sum of these individuals: x + 2x + 4x = 7x.\nGiven that the monster consumed 847 people over the three hundred years, we can set up the equation: 7x = 847.\n\n2. #### 121."}

Tobias also mows lawns for $15 each and he has mowed 4 lawns, so he earned $15 * 4 = $60 from mowing lawns.\n\n3. Tobias also shovels driveways for $7 each. Let's say he shoveled 'x' driveways.\n\n4. After buying the shoes, Tobias has $15 in change. This means his total earnings after saving up money and buying the shoes is $15 (change) + $15 (allowance) + $60 (mowing lawns) + $7x (shoveling driveways) = $95 (cost of shoes).\n\n5.

Each DVD costs $6 to make, and he sells it for 2.5 times that much. He sells 500 movies a day for 5 days a week, so in a week, he sells 500 * 5 = 2500 movies. In 20 weeks, he sells 2500 * 20 = 50,000 movies.\n\nThe profit made on each DVD is (2.5 * $6) - $6 = $9.5.

{"question": "The profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?\n", "answer": "According to the ratio, for every 5 parts that Johnson gets, Mike gets 2 parts\nSince Johnson got $2500, each part is therefore $2500/5 = $<<2500/5=500>>500\nMike will get 2*$500 = $<<2*500=1000>>1000\nAfter buying the shirt he will have $1000-$200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800 left\n#### 800<|endoftext|>", "Incorrect Answer": "1. Johnson's share of the profit is in a 5:2 ratio compared to Mike's share. This means that if Johnson received $2500, then Mike's share would be 2/5 of that amount. To find Mike's share, we first calculate the total ratio parts: 5 (Johnson's parts) + 2 (Mike's parts) = 7 parts. \n\n2. To find how much each part is worth, we divide the total amount received by Johnson ($2500) by the total ratio parts (7): $2500 / 7 = $357.14 per part.\n\n3. Since Mike's share is 2 parts, we multiply $357.14 by 2 to find Mike's total share: $357.14 * 2 = $714.28.\n\n4. Mike then spends $200 on a shirt, reducing his total share by that amount: $714.28 - $200 = $514.28\n\n#### 514"}

How much does John make per hour if he decides to earn the bonus?\n", "answer": "First, we need to determine the length of John's workday if he decides to earn the bonus. We do this by performing 8+2= <<8+2=10>>10 hours for his workday.\nNext, we need to determine his overall pay. We do this by performing 80+20=<<80+20=100>>100 dollars a day.\nWe then determine John's hourly rate by dividing his pay by the number of hours worked, performing 100/10= <<100/10=10>>10 dollars an hour.\n#### 10<|endoftext|>", "Incorrect Answer": "John makes $80 a day for working 8 hours, which means he makes $80/8 = $10 per hour.\n\nIf John decides to work hard and earn the bonus of $20 a day, he would be working for 10 hours a day (8 hours regular + 2 hours extra).\n\nTherefore, if John decides to earn the bonus, he would be making $100 a day for working 10 hours, which means he makes $100/10 = $10 per hour.\n\n### 10"}

{"question": "Gail has two fish tanks. The first tank is twice the size of the second tank. There are 48 gallons of water in the first tank.

Let's start by finding out the size of the second fish tank. Since the first tank is twice the size of the second tank and there are 48 gallons of water in the first tank, the second tank would have 48/2 = 24 gallons of water.\n\n2. Now, we know that one gallon of water is required per inch of fish. Therefore, in the second tank, which has 24 gallons of water, Gail can keep 24 two-inch fish.\n\n3. Moving on to the first tank, where she keeps three-inch fish, we know that there are 48 gallons of water. So, in the first tank, Gail can keep 48 three-inch fish.\n\n4. Now, if one of the three-inch fish in the first tank eats another fish, it means she would have one less fish in the first tank.
